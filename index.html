<p>You know what? My favorite animal is the Goat. And you know why? It's because even if they look stupid, they can climb to a tree without hand or claws. I can be as smart as possible, if you remove my hands I'll stay on the ground...</p>

<p>You can find really cool pictures of beautiful goats with the following link:</p>
